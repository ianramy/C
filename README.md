# C Programming Language

**C** is a **general-purpose programming language** that is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development. It was developed in the early 1970s by **Dennis Ritchie** at **Bell Labs**.

## Why learn C?

C is considered as the fundamental language of computer programming. Many modern languages such as **C++, Java, Python, and Go** derive their syntax from C. So, if you learn C, not only you will have strong grasp of fundamental concepts but also find it easier to learn other programming languages.

Also, C is used in creating almost all of the operating systems and embedded systems. So, if you have interest in low level coding, learning C is mandatory.
